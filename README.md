# CellularPhenotypes
In scRNASeq data, a major challenge is to identify/classify individual cells. From machine learning (statistical inference) to manual interpretation, having sets of well-defined genes, in various tissues and species (Mouse, non-human primates, and human for now) is critical. 

The aim of this curation is to bring together a large and comprehensive repertoire of critical gene sets. That is because many of such gene sets of canonical markers is domain-specific knowledge; spread across published literature, websites, ... etc as well as the biological brains of scientists and experts. To preserve this body of knowledge and in the mantra of open-science, please contribute, promote, and cite this repo. If you choose to contribute, please follow the contribution rules. 


### A comprehensive collection of transcriptomic (and other) markers for identification of individual cells (phenotype, state, etc) at various scopes
